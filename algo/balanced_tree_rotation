Unbalanced condition test :

    !! a tree is unbalanced at node N,if the hight differ between
       N's left child and N's right child is 2.
       hight of leave node is 0.
       hight of null node  is -1

    Node is N
    X is newly inserted
    Left-N is left child of N
    Right-N is right child of N

            A           X < N->element => we inserted X in N's left sub-tree
           / \          X < Left-N->element => we inserted X in Left-N's left sub-tree
          N   E         <=         
         /                                         
        C
       /
      X                 (external)

                
            A           X < N->element => we inserted X in N's left sub-tree
           / \          X > Left-N->element => we inserted X in Left-N's right sub-tree
          N   E         <=
         /

           / \          X > Right-N->element => we inserted X in Right-N's right sub-tree
          B   N         <=
               \

              X         (internal)

Rotation :
  external case need once rotation.
  internal case need twice rotations.

  left-to-right rotation :
    Left-N become N's parent, N become Left-N's right child
    Left-N instead the old position of N
  right-to-left rotation :
    Right-N become N's parent, N become Right-N's left child
    Right-N instead the old position of N

  external :
          
          R        =>        R
         / \                / \

               \
                X

  internal :

          R        =>        R        =>        R
         / \                / \                / \

       /                  /                  / \
      C                  X                  C   N
       \                /
        X              C

          R        =>        R        =>        R
         / \                / \                / \
        E   N              E   N              E   X
             \                  \                / \
              C                  X              N   C
             /                    \
            X                      C

    ! for internal case,we need to rotate the tree once to let
      it become external case,and then rotate it again to let it
      become balanced.
